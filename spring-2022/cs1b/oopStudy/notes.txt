* In object oriented programming we come at the problem by trying to figure out what data we are going to use.

* A Class is a definition of a data type, but it is a compound data type meaning it can have more than one data type in
it.

* Field is data inside the class also known as a whole member

* Methods is something that classes just have for example if we have a cat class well cats meow that would go for
all cats therefore it is a method in a class not a field but does not mean cats can not have a different type
of meow just that it has a meow.

* Classes may over lap this is called inheritance, lets take an example you have three classes Animal, Mammal, and
Cat because a mammal is a animal it would have all the methods and or fields inside animal with that being said
a cat is a mammal so it has everything that mammal and animal have.

* Inheritance is a very useful for not mistaking or getting incorrect meaning to some members inside classes

* Do not be mistaken in using inheritance all over the place, as brian said a good way for making sure to use
inheritance only when it is needed is the is-a and has-a rule.

* Is-a is very simple a Cat IS-A kind of mammal therefore inheritance works

* Has-a is saying a Car HAS-A a steering wheel but a steering IS NOT a car
