# Raw Notes - Introduction to Networks and Distributed Computing

## What is a Distributed System?

- "A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system"
- Enslow's Definition: Distributed System = Distributed hardware + Distributed control + Distributed data
- Middleware layer extends over multiple machines, provides consistent interaction

## Why Distributed Computing?

- Big data keeps growing (Google processes 20 petabytes/day)
- Applications are data-intensive
- Individual computers have limited resources:
  - Memory hierarchy latency: L1 (2-4 cycles) → L2 (6-15) → L3 (30-50) → RAM (300+) → HDD (3 billion+)
  - CPU speed grows 55% annually, memory only 7% (speed gap problem)
- Example: 4TB dataset takes 3 hours on single machine vs 3 minutes on 100 distributed machines

## New Requirements for Distributed Systems

1. Programming Models - express problems as parallel processes
2. Communication - processes exchange information
3. Synchronization - cooperate and agree on shared values
4. Consistency & Replication - reliability and performance
5. Fault Tolerance - recover from partial failures
6. Security - protect communication and access rights
7. Virtualization - extend interfaces, reduce platform diversity

## Goals

### Transparency Types

- Access - hide data representation differences
- Location - hide where resource is located
- Migration - hide that resource may move
- Relocation - hide moves while in use
- Replication - hide that resource may be copied
- Concurrency - hide that resource is shared
- Failure - hide failure and recovery
- Persistence - hide if resource is in memory or disk

### Scalability

- Centralized solutions don't scale (services, data, algorithms)
- Challenges: geography, ownership domains, time sync
- Scaling techniques:
  1. **Hiding latency** - async communication, don't block user
  2. **Distribution** - spread info to multiple locations (e.g., DNS hierarchy)
  3. **Replication** - copy info to increase availability (e.g., CDNs, P2P, caching)
  - Issue: consistency of replicated data

## System Architectures

1. Client-Server - clients invoke servers
2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) - all nodes are equal peers with sharable objects
3. Multiple Servers - service provided by multiple servers
4. Proxy Servers - intermediary for caching
5. Mobile Code/Applets - code downloads and runs on client
6. Thin Clients - minimal client, compute server does heavy lifting

## Cloud Computing

Key characteristics:

- On-demand, dynamic resource allocation ("elasticity")
- Resource abstraction
- Self-managed
- Pay for what you use (CPU time, storage)
- Standardized interfaces

### XaaS Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure)** - virtualized hardware (servers, storage, networking, OS)

  - Example: Amazon EC2
  - User manages: OS, middleware, runtime, data, apps

- **PaaS (Platform)** - integrated dev environment (design, testing, deployment, hosting)

  - Example: Google App Engine
  - User manages: data, application development

- **SaaS (Software)** - application software provided to end user

  - Examples: Gmail, Google Docs, Facebook
  - Maturity levels 1-4 (from individual instances to load-balanced farms)

- HuaaS (Human) - crowdsourcing (Amazon Mechanical Turk)

## Applications of Distributed Systems

- Finance/commerce: e-commerce, banking, trading
- Information: search engines, social networks
- Entertainment: online gaming, streaming, YouTube
- Healthcare: patient records, monitoring
- Education: e-learning, distance learning
- Transport: GPS, maps
- Science: Grid computing for collaboration
- Environment: sensor networks for monitoring
